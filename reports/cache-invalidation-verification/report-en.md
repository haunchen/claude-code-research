# Cache Invalidation Verification — Why MCP Tool Discovery Doesn't Actually Bust the Prompt Cache

> **CLI Version:** @anthropic-ai/claude-code v2.1.85 (build 2026-03-26)
> **Date:** 2026-03-28
> **Status:** Verified (source code + official docs + live experiment)

---

## Summary

We set out to verify a seemingly obvious claim: when Claude Code's deferred tool loading system discovers a new MCP tool via ToolSearch, the tools array changes, the cache prefix shifts, and the entire prompt cache is rebuilt at 125% cost. The embedded documentation inside cli.js itself says so — "adding, removing, or reordering a tool invalidates the entire cache."

We ran a live experiment at 283k context tokens and watched /cost. Nothing moved.

This report traces the complete investigation: reverse-engineering CLI v2.1.85, searching 15+ GitHub issues, and reading Anthropic's official API documentation. The answer is that `defer_loading` is not just a flag that delays tool schema delivery — it fundamentally changes how the server treats tool definitions in the cache prefix. Deferred tools are excluded from the prefix entirely. The cache stays intact.

Non-deferred tools still bust cache exactly as documented. The system prompt cache strategy itself shifts depending on whether non-deferred MCP tools exist. And there are at least six other operations that trigger full cache rebuilds. This report maps all of them.

## 1. The Prediction and the Contradiction

### The reasoning chain

Our original analysis went like this:

1. Anthropic's prompt cache uses **strict prefix matching**. The server computes a cache key from the byte-for-byte content of the request, in render order: `tools → system → messages`.
2. Claude Code's deferred tool loading system starts with MCP tools **excluded** from the tools array. When ToolSearch discovers a tool, it gets **added** to the array on the next turn.
3. Adding a tool changes the tools array. Since tools render at position 0, everything after them — system prompt, all messages — becomes a prefix mismatch.
4. A prefix mismatch forces a full cache rewrite at 125% of base input cost.

At 283k context tokens, a full rewrite would cost the equivalent of ~354k tokens at the cache write rate. This should have been clearly visible in /cost.

### The experiment

- **Setup:** Active Claude Code CLI session (Opus 4, Claude Max subscription), 283k context, 27% of 5-hour quota consumed, multiple MCP servers connected.
- **Action:** Used ToolSearch to fetch an MCP tool schema for the first time in the conversation.
- **Expected result:** /cost jumps by several percentage points (estimated 3-7%).
- **Actual result:** /cost remained at 27%. No observable change.

### The question

Where did the reasoning chain break? Was the cache bust happening but invisible? Or was the mechanism itself different from what we assumed?

---

## 2. How Prompt Caching Actually Works

Before diving into why deferred tools are special, we need to establish the baseline — how does Claude Code's cache system work in CLI v2.1.85?

### Render order

The Anthropic API processes request content in a fixed order for cache prefix computation, regardless of how the JSON keys are arranged in the request body:

```
Position 0: tools array      (all tool definitions)
Position 1: system prompt     (all system blocks)
Position 2: messages          (conversation history)
```

This is confirmed by embedded documentation inside cli.js (character offset ~12553825):

> *"Render order is: tools → system → messages. A breakpoint on the last system block caches both tools and system together."*

The JS object literal in the code orders keys as `model → messages → system → tools`, but this is irrelevant. The API server always processes them in the canonical render order above.

### How cache_control breakpoints work

A `cache_control` marker on a content block tells the server: "compute a cache key for everything from the start of the request up to and including this block." If the key matches an existing cache entry, everything before this point is read from cache (10% cost). If it doesn't match, everything is written to a new cache entry (125% cost).

The factory function that produces these markers is `XU()` (character offset ~11366730):

```js
function XU({scope, querySource} = {}) {
  return {
    type: "ephemeral",                              // always present
    ...MVY(querySource) ? {ttl: "1h"} : {},         // 1h TTL for allowlisted sources
    ...scope === "global" ? {scope: "global"} : {}   // cross-session caching
  }
}
```

Three fields, each with specific meaning:
- **`type: "ephemeral"`** — standard prompt cache marker, always present
- **`ttl: "1h"`** — extended TTL (default is 5 minutes). Enabled when the source passes a feature flag check (`MVY()`). Cache writes at 1h TTL cost 2x base price instead of 1.25x, but reads are still 10%.
- **`scope: "global"`** — allows cache entries to be shared across conversations. Only applied to static content that doesn't change between sessions.

### What gets a breakpoint and what doesn't

This is the critical detail that our original analysis missed. Not every part of the request gets a `cache_control` marker. Here's what cli.js actually does:

| Content | Gets `cache_control`? | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|----------------------|-------|---------|
| Tool definitions | **No** (by default) | — | Tools are cached implicitly as part of the prefix before the system breakpoint |
| System prompt static zone | **Yes** | `"org"` or `"global"` | Caches tools + system together |
| System prompt dynamic zone | **No** | — | Changes frequently (date, git status), left uncached |
| Last 1-2 messages | **Yes** | per-query | Sliding window that moves forward each turn |

The tool definitions have **no** `cache_control` of their own. The function `vm8()` that converts tools to API format only adds `cache_control` if explicitly passed a `cacheControl` parameter — and the main query function `vuK()` never passes one:

```js
// vm8() — tool schema builder
async function vm8(tool, options) {
  let schema = {
    name: tool.name,
    description: await tool.prompt(...),
    input_schema: tool.inputSchema
  };
  if (options.deferLoading) schema.defer_loading = true;
  if (options.cacheControl) schema.cache_control = options.cacheControl;  // never called in practice
  return schema;
}
```

This means tools are cached **only because they come before the system prompt breakpoint**. The system prompt's `cache_control` marker creates a breakpoint that covers everything before it — including all tools. There is no independent tool-level cache.

---

## 3. The Complete Cache Breakpoint Map

Here is every location in a CLI v2.1.85 API request that receives a `cache_control` marker:

### System prompt breakpoints (via `yVY()` → `Z57()`)

The system prompt is split into blocks and processed by `Z57()`, which assigns a `cacheScope` to each block. Then `yVY()` converts those into actual `cache_control` markers:

```js
// yVY() — system prompt formatter
function yVY(blocks, cachingEnabled, options) {
  return Z57(blocks, options).map(block => ({
    type: "text",
    text: block.text,
    // Only add cache_control if caching is enabled AND scope is not null
    ...cachingEnabled && block.cacheScope !== null
      ? {cache_control: XU({scope: block.cacheScope, querySource: options?.querySource})}
      : {}
  }));
}
```

Blocks with `cacheScope: null` get **no** cache marker — they're in the "dynamic zone" that changes between turns.

### Message breakpoints (via `kVY()` → `WVY()` / `ZVY()`)

```js
// kVY() — message array processor
function kVY(messages, cachingEnabled, querySource, cacheEditing, ..., skipCacheWrite) {
  // Target index: last message, or second-to-last if skipCacheWrite
  let targetIndex = skipCacheWrite ? messages.length - 2 : messages.length - 1;

  return messages.map((msg, index) => {
    let isTarget = index === targetIndex;
    if (msg.type === "user") return WVY(msg, isTarget, cachingEnabled, querySource);
    return ZVY(msg, isTarget, cachingEnabled, querySource);
  });
}
```

Only the last (or second-to-last) message gets a breakpoint, and only on its final content block. This creates a sliding window — each new turn shifts the breakpoint forward, and the server reads everything before it from cache.

### Auto-mode classifier breakpoints

The auto-mode classifier (which decides whether to use agent mode) has its own independent cache markers:
- CLAUDE.md config block → `cache_control` with `querySource: "auto_mode"`
- Classifier system prompt → `cache_control` with `querySource: "auto_mode"`
- Last transcript action → `cache_control` with `querySource: "auto_mode"`

These don't interact with the main conversation cache.

## 4. Three Cache Strategies Inside Z57

The `Z57()` function is the decision engine for system prompt caching. It has three distinct branches, and which one executes depends on two conditions: whether global caching is enabled, and whether non-deferred MCP tools exist.

### Branch 1: Standard mode (no global cache)

**Condition:** Global cache feature flag is off.

```
billing header    → cacheScope: null    (not cached)
org-scope blocks  → cacheScope: "org"   (cached at org level)
remaining content → cacheScope: "org"   (cached at org level, joined into one block)
```

This is the simplest path. System prompt blocks get `ephemeral` cache markers. The system breakpoint caches everything before it, including all tools.

### Branch 2: Global cache with boundary marker

**Condition:** Global cache is on, no non-deferred MCP tools, and the dynamic boundary marker `__SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY__` exists in the prompt.

```
static blocks (before boundary)  → cacheScope: "global"   (cross-session cache)
dynamic blocks (after boundary)  → cacheScope: null        (not cached)
```

The `scope: "global"` marker tells the server this content is identical across conversations — cache it once and share it. This is the most efficient mode but requires stable content.

### Branch 3: Tool-based cache mode

**Condition:** Global cache is on, AND at least one **non-deferred** MCP tool exists in the active tool set.

This branch has the most confusing name. "Tool-based cache" doesn't mean tools get their own `cache_control`. It means the **system prompt gives up its global cache scope** because the presence of non-deferred MCP tools makes the tools-to-system prefix unstable.

Here's the actual code logic:

```js
// In vuK() — the main query function:

// W = is global cache enabled?
let W = isGlobalCacheEnabled() && (forceGlobalCache || featureFlag("tengu_system_prompt_global_cache"));

// Z = is this tool deferred?
let Z = (tool) => toolSearchEnabled && (isDeferredTool(tool) || isLspConnecting(tool));

// G = are there any non-deferred MCP tools?
let G = W && activeTools.some(tool => tool.isMcp === true && !Z(tool));

// G controls the cache strategy:
let globalCacheStrategy = W ? (G ? "none" : "system_prompt") : "none";

// G is passed to yVY as skipGlobalCacheForSystemPrompt
let systemBlocks = yVY(prompt, cachingEnabled, {skipGlobalCacheForSystemPrompt: G, ...});
```

When `G` is true (non-deferred MCP tools exist):

```
billing header    → cacheScope: null    (not cached)
org-scope blocks  → cacheScope: "org"   (downgraded from "global" to "org")
remaining content → cacheScope: "org"   (downgraded)
```

The telemetry event `tengu_sysprompt_using_tool_based_cache` fires to record this downgrade.

**Why does this happen?** Non-deferred MCP tools have full schemas in the tools array. If an MCP server restarts with different tool descriptions, the tools prefix changes, invalidating any `scope: "global"` cache entry. By downgrading to `"org"` scope, the system avoids sharing a potentially unstable cache across conversations.

**The key insight for deferred tools:** Deferred tools have `Z(tool) = true`, so `!Z(tool) = false`. They **never** trigger `G`. When all MCP tools are deferred (which is the normal case with ToolSearch enabled), `G` stays false, and the system prompt retains its `"global"` or `"org"` cache scope. Deferred tools don't affect this calculation at all.

---

## 5. The Deferred Tool Loading Pipeline

Understanding why deferred tools don't bust cache requires understanding the full pipeline from "tool registered" to "tool in API request."

### Step 1: All MCP tools start as deferred

The function `isDeferredTool()` (internally `I0()`, offset ~5318984) has a simple first check:

```js
function isDeferredTool(tool) {
  if (tool.isMcp === true) return true;   // ALL MCP tools are deferred
  if (tool.name === "ToolSearch") return false;
  // ... other checks for feature flags
  return tool.shouldDefer === true;
}
```

Every MCP tool, regardless of configuration, returns `true`. This is not configurable from the user side.

### Step 2: Tool Search mode decides what enters the tools array

The function `Ir6()` determines the tool loading mode:

| Mode | Condition | Behavior |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `"tst"` (tool search) | `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` or `=0` | ToolSearch active, deferred tools filtered |
| `"tst-auto"` | Deferred tool tokens exceed context threshold | Auto-activates tool search |
| `"standard"` | None of the above | All tools sent, ToolSearch excluded |

When tool search mode is active (`J = true`), the tools array is filtered:

```js
// X = tools that actually get sent to the API
X = allTools.filter(tool => {
  if (!isDeferredTool(tool)) return true;     // non-deferred: always included
  if (tool.name === "ToolSearch") return true; // ToolSearch itself: always included
  return discoveredTools.has(tool.name);       // deferred: only if previously discovered
});
```

Undiscovered deferred tools are **completely absent** from the API request.

### Step 3: Discovery scanner finds tool_reference blocks

Before each API call, the scanner function `wU()` walks the entire message history looking for `tool_reference` blocks — these are created when ToolSearch returns results:

```js
function extractDiscoveredToolNames(messages) {
  let discovered = new Set();
  for (let msg of messages) {
    if (msg.role !== "user") continue;
    for (let block of msg.content) {
      if (block.type === "tool_result") {
        for (let inner of block.content) {
          if (inner.type === "tool_reference") {
            discovered.add(inner.tool_name);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  // Also recover from compaction metadata
  // ...
  return discovered;
}
```

### Step 4: Discovered tools enter the array with defer_loading: true

When a tool is discovered, it passes the `X` filter and gets sent to the API. But it **still** has `defer_loading: true`:

```js
// Z = should this tool be marked as deferred?
let Z = (tool) => toolSearchEnabled && (isDeferredTool(tool) || isLspConnecting(tool));

// In vm8():
if (options.deferLoading) schema.defer_loading = true;
// deferLoading = Z(tool) — true for all MCP tools, even discovered ones
```

The tool enters the API request with its full schema (name, description, input_schema) **plus** the `defer_loading: true` flag. This flag is the key signal to the server.

### Step 5: Server-side expansion via tool_reference

The `tool_reference` blocks in the message history tell the server where to make the tool available. From Anthropic's documentation:

> "Tool Search Tool doesn't break prompt caching because deferred tools are excluded from the initial prompt entirely. They're only added to context after Claude searches for them, so your system prompt and core tool definitions remain cacheable."

The server expands `tool_reference` blocks inline within the message history, not by modifying the tools prefix. The prefix — which determines cache key matching — remains stable.

### Timeline view

```
Turn 1 (before discovery):
  tools: [Bash, Read, Write, ..., ToolSearch]
  system: [...cache_control breakpoint here...]
  messages: [user: "do something"]
  → Cache: tools+system cached together ✓

Turn 2 (ToolSearch called):
  tools: [Bash, Read, Write, ..., ToolSearch]          ← unchanged
  system: [same...]
  messages: [..., assistant: calls ToolSearch, user: tool_result with tool_reference]
  → Cache: tools+system HIT ✓, messages extended

Turn 3 (after discovery):
  tools: [Bash, Read, Write, ..., ToolSearch, mcp__server__tool(defer_loading:true)]
  system: [same...]
  messages: [...]
  → Client-side tools array changed, BUT server ignores defer_loading tools in prefix
  → Cache: tools+system HIT ✓ (server excludes deferred tools from prefix)
```

---

## 6. Why Deferred Tools Don't Bust Cache — The Full Evidence Chain

Our original prediction was wrong. Here is the complete evidence chain for why:

### Evidence 1: API design constraint — defer_loading XOR cache_control

The Anthropic API explicitly rejects requests where a tool has both `defer_loading: true` and a `cache_control` marker. From [GitHub Issue #30920](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/30920):

```
API Error 400:
"Tool 'mcp__atlassian__getConfluencePage' cannot have both defer_loading=true
and cache_control set. Tools with defer_loading cannot use prompt caching."
```

This is not a bug — it's an intentional design constraint. If deferred tools participated in the cache prefix, they would need `cache_control` markers to define breakpoints. The API forbids this combination because **deferred tools are architecturally excluded from the prefix**.

**Evidence strength: Confirmed** (API behavior, reproducible error message)

### Evidence 2: Official documentation

Anthropic's Tool Search Tool documentation states:

> "Tool Search Tool doesn't break prompt caching because deferred tools are excluded from the initial prompt entirely. They're only added to context after Claude searches for them, so your system prompt and core tool definitions remain cacheable."

**Evidence strength: Confirmed** (official documentation)

### Evidence 3: Source code — deferred tools don't trigger cache strategy downgrade

The `skipGlobalCacheForSystemPrompt` flag, which downgrades system prompt caching, is calculated as:

```js
let G = globalCacheEnabled && activeTools.some(tool => tool.isMcp === true && !isDeferred(tool));
```

Deferred tools (`isDeferred = true`) produce `!isDeferred = false`, so they're excluded from this check. Even when a deferred tool is discovered and added to the tools array, it remains deferred (`isDeferredTool()` returns true for all MCP tools unconditionally). The system prompt cache strategy is never affected.

**Evidence strength: Confirmed** (source code, CLI v2.1.85)

### Evidence 4: Live experiment

At 283k context tokens, we used ToolSearch to discover an MCP tool and continued the conversation. The /cost indicator showed no change (remained at 27% of 5-hour quota).

A full cache rebuild at this context size would have cost approximately:
- Cache write: ~283k × 1.25 = ~354k token-equivalents
- At Opus 4 rates ($15/MTok input): ~$5.31 per bust
- As percentage of a ~1M token 5-hour budget: ~3-7%

The absence of any /cost change is consistent with the cache remaining intact.

**Evidence strength: Supporting** (consistent with hypothesis, but /cost precision could mask small changes)

### Evidence 5: Bug history confirms the constraint is enforced

CLI v2.1.69 had a bug where it accidentally set both `defer_loading` and `cache_control` on MCP tools. The result was not a cache bust — it was a **hard API error** that broke all MCP tool calls entirely ([Issue #30989](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/30989)). The API doesn't silently handle this case; it rejects the request outright. This confirms that the server treats deferred tools as fundamentally incompatible with cache participation.

**Evidence strength: Confirmed** (reproducible regression in v2.1.69)

### Evidence 6: Design intent

The entire deferred tool loading system exists to reduce token cost. Issue [#124 in the Agent SDK repo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/issues/124) documents that a typical multi-server MCP setup consumes 15,000-20,000 tokens in tool definitions. Deferred loading reduces this by 85%+. If discovering a deferred tool triggered a full cache rebuild (125% of the entire context), the cost savings would be negated on first use — defeating the system's purpose.

**Evidence strength: Reasoning** (design intent, not direct proof)

### Conclusion: Where the original reasoning broke

The reasoning chain broke at step 3:

> ~~3. Adding a tool changes the tools array. Since tools render at position 0, everything after them becomes a prefix mismatch.~~

**Corrected:** Adding a **non-deferred** tool changes the cache prefix. Adding a **deferred** tool (one with `defer_loading: true`) does not, because the server excludes deferred tools from the prefix calculation. The `defer_loading` flag is the server-side signal that separates these two cases.

The embedded documentation that says "adding a tool invalidates the entire cache" is correct for the general case — it describes what happens when you add a regular tool definition. It does not account for the `defer_loading` mechanism, which was introduced later as part of the `advanced-tool-use-2025-11-20` beta.

## 7. What Actually Does Bust Cache — A Practical Scenario Guide

Not all cache invalidations are created equal. Some destroy the entire prefix. Some only affect the messages layer. Here's a complete map based on CLI v2.1.85 source code analysis.

### Full prefix invalidation (tools + system + all messages rebuilt)

| Scenario | Why it busts | Cost at 200k context | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Adding a non-deferred tool** | Tools prefix changes at position 0 | ~$3.75 (125% write) | Embedded docs |
| **MCP server restart with different tool descriptions** | Tool schema bytes change | ~$3.75 | Tool serialization analysis |
| **Model switch mid-conversation** | Cache key includes model ID | ~$3.75 | API design |
| **Switching from standard to tool-search mode** | Tools array composition changes (ToolSearch added, deferred tools removed) | ~$3.75 | Source code |
| **CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS toggle** | Strips non-standard fields from tool schemas, changing bytes | ~$3.75 | vm8() beta stripping logic |

### System prompt invalidation (system + messages rebuilt, tools cached)

| Scenario | Why it busts | Cost at 200k context | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Date rollover (currentDate change)** | Dynamic zone content changes | ~$3.00 (system + messages only) | System prompt analysis |
| **CLAUDE.md edit during conversation** | System prompt content changes | ~$3.00 | System prompt rebuild |
| **Git status change between turns** | Dynamic zone includes git info | ~$3.00 | System prompt analysis |
| **First non-deferred MCP tool appears** | Triggers tool-based cache strategy switch (global → org scope) | ~$3.00 | Z57() branch logic |

### Messages-only invalidation (only new messages not cached)

| Scenario | Why it busts | Cost | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Normal conversation turn** | New message added, breakpoint slides forward | Minimal (only new content written) | kVY() sliding window |
| **Tool result content** | Tool outputs become part of messages | Proportional to output size | Normal operation |

### Full context rebuild (everything reprocessed)

| Scenario | Why it busts | Cost at 200k context | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Context compaction (auto-compact)** | Messages rewritten by summarization, prefix changes | ~$3.75 + chain reaction risk | Compaction analysis |
| **Session resume (close + reopen)** | Entire request reconstructed from persisted state | ~$3.75 | Session architecture |
| **Cache TTL expiry (idle > 5min or > 1h)** | Server evicts cache entry | ~$3.75 on next request | XU() TTL logic |

### No cache impact

| Scenario | Why it's safe | Evidence |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Discovering MCP tool via ToolSearch** | defer_loading excludes from prefix | This report |
| **Using Skill tool** | Skill content appended to messages (end of prefix), doesn't change tools or system | Skill architecture |
| **Reading files (Read tool)** | Output goes into messages, breakpoint slides normally | Normal operation |
| **Multiple ToolSearch calls in sequence** | Each discovery adds defer_loading tools; prefix unchanged | defer_loading mechanism |

### Cost estimation formula

For any cache invalidation event, the cost depends on what gets rebuilt:

```
Full prefix rebuild cost = (tools_tokens + system_tokens + messages_tokens) × write_rate
System rebuild cost     = (system_tokens + messages_tokens) × write_rate
Messages rebuild cost   = (new_message_tokens) × write_rate

Where:
  write_rate = $1.25 per MTok (5m TTL) or $2.00 per MTok (1h TTL) for cache writes
  read_rate  = $0.10 per MTok for cache hits

Cost difference per bust = rebuild_cost - (what_would_have_been_read × read_rate)
                         ≈ context_tokens × (write_rate - read_rate)
```

At 200k context tokens with 1h TTL:
- Full rebuild: 200k × $2.00/MTok = $0.40 (write cost)
- What you'd have paid with cache hit: 200k × $0.10/MTok = $0.02 (read cost)
- **Net cost of one cache bust: ~$0.38**

At 500k context tokens with 1h TTL:
- **Net cost of one cache bust: ~$0.95**

These numbers are per-bust. In a long conversation with frequent busts (e.g., CLAUDE.md auto-saves, git operations between turns), costs compound.

- **GitHub issue search** across anthropics/claude-code and anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript
- **Anthropic API documentation** (docs.anthropic.com)
- **Live experiment** in an active Claude Code CLI session

### Reverse engineering approach

CLI v2.1.85's cli.js is a single 12.9MB minified JavaScript file. Function names are mangled (e.g., `XU`, `Z57`, `vm8`, `vuK`, `I0`, `wU`, `kVY`), but string literals — telemetry event names, error messages, embedded documentation — are preserved in cleartext. We used these as anchors to locate and trace the relevant code paths.

Key anchors:
- `"cache_control"` → breakpoint placement logic
- `"tengu_sysprompt_using_tool_based_cache"` → tool-based cache strategy
- `"skipGlobalCacheForSystemPrompt"` → strategy switching condition
- `"defer_loading"` → deferred tool handling
- `"tool_reference"` → discovery scanner
- `"Render order is: tools"` → embedded documentation

### Verification

Every claim in this report falls into one of three categories:

- **Confirmed (source code):** Directly verified in cli.js v2.1.85. Minified function names are cited for reproducibility.
- **Confirmed (external):** Verified through official Anthropic documentation or reproducible GitHub issue reports.
- **Reasoning:** Logical inference from confirmed facts. Explicitly marked where used.
